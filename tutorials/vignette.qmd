# Usage Tutorial

The `canadataClean` package helps you standardize and validate Canada-specific data including dates, postal codes, province names, and phone numbers in Python pandas workflows. Use this guide to see the main functions in action.

---

## Installation

You can install `canadataClean` in several ways, depending on your needs:

### From PyPI (standard users)

```bash
pip install canadataClean
```

### From TestPyPI (for testing latest releases)

To try the latest release candidate or pre-release, install from [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) using:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple canadataClean
```

> **Note:** TestPyPI is a separate package index for testing purposes. If you previously installed from regular PyPI, consider uninstalling first:
> ```bash
> pip uninstall canadataClean
> ```

### For Contributors: Using Conda

If you wish to develop or contribute:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate canadataClean
```

## Quickstart Examples

We'll show all major functions with realistic usage and outputs.

### 1. Standardizing Dates: `clean_date`

```python
from canadataClean import clean_date

# Example: various date formats
dates = [
    "2023-12-01",
    "01/12/2023",
    "12-01-2023",
    "Dec 1, 2023"
]

for d in dates:
    print(f"Input: {d}  -->  Output: {clean_date(d)}")
```

**What it does:**  
`clean_date` converts various common formats to the ISO 8601 Canadian standard (`YYYY-MM-DD`).  
If invalid, it raises a warning but lets your code continue.

---

### 2. Standardizing Postal Codes: `clean_postalcode`

```python
from canadataClean import clean_postalcode

codes = ["v6t1z4", "V6T 1Z4", "V6T--1Z4", "invalid"]

for c in codes:
    print(f"Input: {c}  -->  Output: {clean_postalcode(c)}")
```
**What it does:**  
Ensures output is in proper Canadian format: e.g., "V6T 1Z4".  
If a value is invalid, raises a warning.

---

### 3. Standardizing Provinces & Territories: `clean_location`

```python
from canadataClean import clean_location

locations = [
    "British Columbia", "BC", "ontario", "Ontario", "quebec", "Que."
]

for loc in locations:
    print(f"Input: {loc}  -->  Output: {clean_location(loc)}")
```
**What it does:**  
Maps full names and abbreviations (case-insensitive, various spelling) to their standard 2-letter province/territory code.

---

### 4. Standardizing Phone Numbers: `clean_phonenumber`

```python
from canadataClean import clean_phonenumber

numbers = [
    "604-822-1234", "(604) 822-1234", "+1 604 822 1234", "1234567890", "not a number"
]

for n in numbers:
    print(f"Input: {n}  -->  Output: {clean_phonenumber(n)}")
```
**What it does:**  
Formats phone numbers to "+1 (XXX) XXX-XXXX" style; warns if invalid.

---

## Applying to a DataFrame

You can use these functions alongside pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd
from canadataClean import clean_date, clean_postalcode, clean_location, clean_phonenumber

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "date": ["2024/01/28", "Jan 28, 2024"],
    "postal_code": ["v6t1z4", "M5S-2E4"],
    "province": ["British Columbia", "Ontario"],
    "phone": ["(604)822-1234", "+1 416 555 0123"]
})

df["date"] = df["date"].apply(clean_date)
df["postal_code"] = df["postal_code"].apply(clean_postalcode)
df["province"] = df["province"].apply(clean_location)
df["phone"] = df["phone"].apply(clean_phonenumber)

print(df)
```
